Filtering out sites that map to the same genomic location...

- Of 466,338,096 sites that could be genomically mapped, 44,176,440 sites mapped to overlapping reference positions and were removed.

A genome map file for HomSap without overlapping sites was created at /data3/schwartzlab/bob/Rerun_Mammals/Primates/Post_SISRS_Processing/Whole_Genome_Mapping/WholeGenomeHomSap_Mapped_NonDup.bed

Beginning site selection...

- Of 12,032,712 requested sites from the SISRS_Biallelic_NoMissing dataset, 11,658,897 sites were able to be genomically mapped based off non-overlapping data from /data3/schwartzlab/bob/Rerun_Mammals/Primates/Post_SISRS_Processing/Whole_Genome_Mapping/WholeGenome_HomSap_Mapped.bed.
- Created BED file for these sites at /data3/schwartzlab/bob/Rerun_Mammals/Primates/Post_SISRS_Processing/SISRS_Sites/HomSap_SISRS_Biallelic_NoMissing_Mapped_NonDup.bed
- Created a loc list for these sites at /data3/schwartzlab/bob/Rerun_Mammals/Primates/Post_SISRS_Processing/SISRS_Sites/HomSap_SISRS_Biallelic_NoMissing_Mapped_NonDup_LocList.txt
