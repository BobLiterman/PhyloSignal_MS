# Code Walkthrough for Literman and Schwartz (2019)  

## Please Note:  
This repo is meant as a specific walkthrough for the analyses performed in Literman and Schwartz (2019).  

**If you wish to re-run this pipeline using your own data, please refer to RUN_REPO**

## 1) Acquiring study data  
In this manuscript, we investigated how phylogenetic signal was distributed across the genomes of three focal mammal clades. The species and their shortened analysis IDs are listed below, with the reference species for each dataset indicated in **bold**. SRR numbers for all species can be found in **Data_and_Tables/SRR_Table.csv**. All reads are Illumina paired-end reads from WGS-type sequencing.  

- Catarrhine primates  (*Primates*)  
  - Colobus angolensis (ColAng)  
  - Gorilla gorilla	(GorGor)  
  - **Homo sapiens	(HomSap)**  
  - Hylobates moloch	(HylMol)  
  - Macaca mulatta	(MacMul)

There was also an analysis will all 36 species combined (*Combined*).  

## 2) Read QC  

Read quality was assessed before and after trimming using FastQC v.0.11.5.  

HTML output from FastQC can be found in **Data_and_Tables/FastQC**  

## 3) Read trimming  

All reads were trimmed using BBDuk v.37.41 using the following command:  
```
bbduk.sh maxns=0 ref=adapters.fa qtrim=w trimq=15 minlength=35 maq=25 in=<RAW_LEFT> in2=<RAW_RIGHT> out=<TRIM_LEFT> out2=<TRIM_RIGHT> k=23 mink=11 hdist=1 hdist2=0 ktrim=r
```
Read trimming scripts and output can be found in **Data_Processing_Scripts/Trim_Scripts**.

## 4) Read subsetting  

The SISRS pipeline identifies orthologous loci through a 'composite genome' assembly step. The first step for this assembly is to subset the reads of each species so that ideally:  

1) Each species is represented in the assembly by the same total number of bases.  
2) Within each species, bases are sampled evenly across read sets.    
3) The pooled base count across species is ~10X genomic coverage.  
  - For this study, we used 3.5Gb as a genome size estimate for all groups.  

For the three focal datasets (Primtes, Rodents, and Pecora):  
- 10X = 35Gb / 12 species ~ 2,916,666,667 bases per species  

For the combined analysis: 10X = 35Gb / 36 species ~ 972,222,222 bases per species

Reads for each dataset (Primates, Rodents, Pecora, Combined) were subset using the script **Data_Processing_Scripts/sisrs_read_subsetter.py**  
```
python sisrs_read_subsetter.py 3500000000
```

Subset schemes used in this study can be found in **Data_and_Tables/Subset_Schemes**  
Output from subsetting can be found in **Data_and_Tables/Subset_Schemes/Subset_Output**  

## 5) Composite genome assembly  

This manuscript uses Ray (https://github.com/sebhtml/ray) to assemble composite genomes. Ray commands were generated automatically by **Data_Processing_Scripts/sisrs_ray_composite.py**  

```
#To run on 8 nodes with 20 processors per node  
python sisrs_ray_composite.py 8 20  

#Outut:
$ mpirun -n 160 Ray -k 31 {-s <READ_FILE>} -o <OUTPUT_DIR>
# Where each subset read file is indicated with a -s flag (e.g. not using paired-end information)
```

Ray assembly scripts can be found in **Data_Processing_Scripts/Ray_Scripts**  

## 6) Running independent SISRS steps  

The next step of SISRS involves converting this single composite genome to multiple, taxon-specific ortholog sequences. This involves a few key steps:  

1) Map reads from each taxon onto composite genome  
2) Replace the composite base with the most common taxon-specific base  
3) Re-map the reads onto the new corrected genome, but for any site with less than 3 reads of coverage or more than 1 possible base, replace with 'N'  

The script **Data_Processing_Scripts/sisrs_setup_run.py** will do the following:  
- Rename Ray contigs to include 'SISRS_' prefix, build a Bowtie2 index, and move to analysis folder  
- Generate scripts to perform Steps 1-3 above  

```
#For 20 processors, minimum read coverage of 3 reads, and 100% intraspecies homozygosity at each called site:
python sisrs_setup_run.py 20 3 1
```
Running this script will prepare the composite genome, then generate a separate SISRS script for each taxon (TAXA), the skeleton of which is below:  
```
#!/bin/sh
bowtie2 -p PROCESSORS -N 1 --local -x BOWTIE2-INDEX -U READS | samtools view -Su -@ PROCESSORS -F 4 - | samtools sort -@ PROCESSORS - -o SISRS_DIR/TAXA/TAXA_Temp.bam

samtools view -@ PROCESSORS -H SISRS_DIR/TAXA/TAXA_Temp.bam > SISRS_DIR/TAXA/TAXA_Header.sam

samtools view -@ PROCESSORS SISRS_DIR/TAXA/TAXA_Temp.bam | grep -v "XS:" | cat SISRS_DIR/TAXA/TAXA_Header.sam - | samtools view -@ PROCESSORS -b - > SISRS_DIR/TAXA/TAXA.bam

rm SISRS_DIR/TAXA/TAXA_Temp.bam
rm SISRS_DIR/TAXA/TAXA_Header.sam

samtools mpileup -f COMPOSITE_GENOME SISRS_DIR/TAXA/TAXA.bam > SISRS_DIR/TAXA/TAXA.pileups

python SCRIPT_DIR/specific_genome.py SISRS_DIR/TAXA COMPOSITE_GENOME

samtools faidx SISRS_DIR/TAXA/contigs.fa
bowtie2-build SISRS_DIR/TAXA/contigs.fa SISRS_DIR/TAXA/contigs -p PROCESSORS

bowtie2 -p PROCESSORS -N 1 --local -x SISRS_DIR/TAXA/contigs -U READS | samtools view -Su -@ PROCESSORS -F 4 - | samtools sort -@ PROCESSORS - -o SISRS_DIR/TAXA/TAXA_Temp.bam

samtools view -@ PROCESSORS -H SISRS_DIR/TAXA/TAXA_Temp.bam > SISRS_DIR/TAXA/TAXA_Header.sam
samtools view -@ PROCESSORS SISRS_DIR/TAXA/TAXA_Temp.bam | grep -v "XS:" | cat SISRS_DIR/TAXA/TAXA_Header.sam - | samtools view -@ PROCESSORS -b - > SISRS_DIR/TAXA/TAXA.bam

rm SISRS_DIR/TAXA/TAXA_Temp.bam
rm SISRS_DIR/TAXA/TAXA_Header.sam

samtools index SISRS_DIR/TAXA/TAXA.bam

samtools mpileup -f COMPOSITE_GENOME SISRS_DIR/TAXA/TAXA.bam > SISRS_DIR/TAXA/TAXA.pileups

python SCRIPT_DIR/get_pruned_dict.py SISRS_DIR/TAXA COMPOSITE_DIR MINREAD THRESHOLD
```

These scripts and their output can be found in **Data_Processing_Scripts/Independent_SISRS_Scripts**  

## 7) Output SISRS alignments

The final step of the SISRS pipeline takes the output from each species and creates a series of alignments:  
- All variable sites
- All variable sites without singletons (parsimony-informative sites)
- All biallelic parsimony-informative sites

Running the script **Data_Processing_Scripts/sisrs_output.py** will generate these alignments both with and without gap positions, and with a number of species allowed to be missing (0 in this study)
```
#To output gapped and ungapped alignments with 0 taxa allowed missing
python sisrs_output.py 0
```

This script will also compile summary outputs assuming that individual SISRS runs have output in the form of out_TAXA_SISRS/err_TAXA_SISRS  

The output from these scripts can be found in **Data_and_Tables/SISRS_Alignment_Output**
