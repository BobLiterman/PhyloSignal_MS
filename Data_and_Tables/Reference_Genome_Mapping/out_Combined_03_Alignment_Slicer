 - 339721 sites from 'alignment_bi_m0.phylip-relaxed' were reduced to 300277 gappless sites (Dataset: HomSap_SISRS_Biallelic_NoMissing). A gap-free alignment file has been generated in /data3/schwartzlab/bob/Rerun_Mammals/Combined/Post_SISRS_Processing/SISRS_Sites/HomSap_SISRS_Biallelic_NoMissing_NoGaps.phylip-relaxed
 - 1678 selected sites from 'alignment_bi_m0.phylip-relaxed' contained potentially informative gap positions. A binary coded gap alignment file and a nexus partition file have been generated in /data3/schwartzlab/bob/Rerun_Mammals/Combined/Post_SISRS_Processing/SISRS_Sites/HomSap_SISRS_Biallelic_NoMissing_RecodedGaps.phylip-relaxed/HomSap_SISRS_Biallelic_NoMissing_Partition.nex
 - To facilitate site-split analysis, a DNA/Gap combined alignment has been generated in /data3/schwartzlab/bob/Rerun_Mammals/Combined/Post_SISRS_Processing/SISRS_Sites/HomSap_SISRS_Biallelic_NoMissing_AllSites.phylip-relaxed
